This is a level meter for the Enlightened sound daemon.

It shows the current output levels for left and right stereo channels, using
what I consider to be an attractive display.

It's under the MIT license, which basically says you can do what you like with
it, but please try to avoid claiming you made it or suing me if it blows
up your computer.

I probably won't add any features, but I'll fix bugs if you find any.

Hint: Use the right mouse button to pop up the configuration menu.

Compiling:
